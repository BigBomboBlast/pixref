# PIXEL REFERENCE
This is some code that is supposed to explain how to decode and deal with raw pixel data in PNGs. I personally don't like Python because it is pseudocode language, but I've come to understand that pseudocode language is actually extremely useful for testing ideas. My plan is to one day write a simple image viewer (and maybe some format conversion tools) in pure assembly, but we'll see. I'd have to implement the zlib.decompress() myself first...

Also, you are correct. My personal coding style is strange. I like using GOTO and handling important data in a managed global scope. Why? Because it is fun.

## USAGE
`python pixref.py the_png.png`
